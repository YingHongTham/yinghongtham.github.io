Hi!

I am a Research Fellow at the Deparment of Genetics
of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
I work with Prof. Scott Emmons to uncover the genetic codes
that determine neuron connections in C. Elegans.
(plan to write a post on it soon!)

I was a graduate student at Stony Brook University
(Aug 2016 - Aug 2021).

Academic work:
- [On the Category of Boundary Values in the Extended Crane-Yetter TQFT (thesis)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13467)
- [Factorization Homology and 4D TQFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08571)
(joint with Alexander Kirillov; Quantum Topology, revised and resubmitted)
- [The Elliptic Drinfeld Center of a Premodular Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09511) (unpublished)
- [Reduced Tensor Product on the Drinfeld Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09611) (invited to resubmit upon revision)
- [Hyperbolicity of Augmented Links in the Thickened Torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10601) (joint with Alice Kwon, unpublished)

Some coding adventures:
- [Treeviz](https://github.com/YingHongTham/treeviz), a simple library for visualizing binary tree operations
