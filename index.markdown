Hi!

![Me](/assets/yinghongtham.jpg)


I am a postdoc at the University of Hamburg,
starting October 2022.
I was a graduate student at Stony Brook University
(Aug 2016 - Aug 2021), my advisor was Alexander Kirillov.

Academic work:
- [Generalization of the Thistlethwaite--Tsvietkova Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01282) (joint with Alice Kwon, Byungdo Park)
- [The Y-Product](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14251) (joint with Alice Kwon)
- [On the Category of Boundary Values in the Extended Crane-Yetter TQFT (PhD thesis)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13467)
- [Hyperbolicity of Augmented Links in the Thickened Torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10601) (joint with Alice Kwon,
[Journal of Knot Theory and Its
Ramifications](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218216522500250))
- [Factorization Homology and 4D TQFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08571)
(joint with Alexander Kirillov; [Quantum
Topology](https://ems.press/journals/qt/articles/5287776),
[QT version](https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/18175))
- [Reduced Tensor Product on the Drinfeld Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09611) ([Journal of Algebra](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2022.05.031))
- [The Elliptic Drinfeld Center of a Premodular Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09511)

Some coding adventures:
- [Treeviz](https://github.com/YingHongTham/treeviz):
	a simple library for visualizing binary tree operations
- [Oreo Constructor](https://yinghongtham.github.io/oreo/index.html):
	make your own Oreo!
