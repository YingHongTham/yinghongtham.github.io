Hi!

I am a graduate student at Stony Brook University (since 2016).

Some coding adventures:
- [Treeviz](https://github.com/YingHongTham/treeviz), a simple library for visualizing binary tree operations

Academic work:
- [Factorization Homology and 4D TQFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08571) (Quantum Topology, under review)
- [The Elliptic Drinfeld Center of a Premodular Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09511) (unpublished)
- [Reduced Tensor Product on the Drinfeld Category](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09611) (unpublished)
- [Hyperbolicity of Augmented Links in the Thickened Torus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10601) (joint with Alice Kwon, unpublished)
